                <h3>A Template for Killer Website Content</h3>

                <p>Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the age-old adage, <span class="inline_content"> “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” </span> can be a two-way street.</p>

                <p>Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers internally, but most don’t.

But sometimes you have to pick your battles.</p>
                
                <p>In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives them a fighting chance to produce effective website content that drives action. Here is a template we like to use, and an explanation of what’s included.</p>
